## Overview
Helix is a modern, high-performance game engine designed to provide developers with a powerful, flexible, and extensible framework for creating interactive experiences across multiple platforms.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§
This engine is currently under active development, building upon the foundational work from the Cherno's Hazel Game Engine series.

## Vision
To create a lightweight, efficient game engine that balances performance, ease of use, and flexibility for game developers of all skill levels.

## Key Features (Planned and In Development)

### Core Engine Architecture
- Cross-platform support
- Modular and extensible design
- High-performance rendering
- Robust memory management
- Advanced input handling

### Rendering
- Multi-API support (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX)
- Advanced shader system
- Deferred rendering
- Post-processing effects
- PBR (Physically Based Rendering) support

### Systems
- Entity Component System (ECS)
- Advanced scene management
- Physics integration
- Comprehensive asset pipeline
- Scripting support

## Development Roadmap

### Short-Term Goals
- Stabilize core engine architecture
- Implement basic rendering system
